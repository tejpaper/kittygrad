This subpackage contains all necessary utilities. The structure is as follows:

- **classes.py** defines auxiliary classes,
- **constants.py** contains most global constants, including auxiliary variables for type hinting. It also inherits NumPy data types supported by kittygrad,
- **exceptions.py** defines functions solely for raising specific exceptions, without any additional code,
- **functions.py** covers all other cases of utility functionality.
